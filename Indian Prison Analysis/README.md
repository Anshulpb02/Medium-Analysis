# Analysis of Prison Statistics in India (2019): A Comprehensive Overview of Prisoner Demographics and Occupancy Rates by State and Union Territory

Today, I examined data from the Open Government Data — Prison Statistics — 2019, an online database detailing the Indian criminal system, to analyze prison attributes by state. I sorted all states and Union terrorists with the most recent data available by government site as of 2019 and color-coded them by quintiles.

### Number of Prisoners in State/UT

The lighter color indicates safer States/UTs (or states/UTs with less stringent law enforcement where gangsters might not be imprisoned).

Uttar Pradesh has a higher prisoner population than any other state/UT based on reported statistics. The Uttar Pradesh and Madhya have prisoner populations significantly higher than others. Lakshadweep and Puducherry are depicted with zero prisoners, highlighting their unique status with no incarcerated individuals compared to other states/UTs.

### Female Prisoner

The graph shows the number of female prisoners in each state and union territory (UT) in India. There is a large variation in the number of female prisoners across the states and UTs.

The state with the highest number of female prisoners is Uttar Pradesh, with 1,158. Madhya Pradesh is second with 788, followed by Bihar with 348.

Several states and UTs have very few female prisoners (between 1 and 4). These include Mizoram, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Daman & Diu, Lakshadweep, and D&N Haveli.

### Foreign Prisoners

Several states and UTs, including Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Mizoram, and Nagaland, have no foreign prisoners, according to the graph.

West Bengal has the highest number (1379) of foreign prisoners. This article gives the reason why it has the highest number of foreign prisoners, as West Bengal shares a long border with Bangladesh and there are laws in place to regulate entry. If someone is caught crossing illegally, they’re likely to be charged under the Foreigners Act, which can result in imprisonment for several years.

### The most crowded prisons

The graphs show the prison occupancy level in various states and union territories of India. The occupancy level is represented by two bars for each state or UT, likely representing overcrowding. The horizontal axis shows the state/UT and the vertical axis shows the occupancy rate in percentage. Here are some observations about the graph:

Overall, the prison occupancy rate in India appears to be high, with many states exceeding 100% occupancy. This suggests overcrowding in prisons across the country. Delhi has the highest occupancy rate, with a peak of 174.9%. Several other states and UTs are also above 150% occupancy, including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Sikkim.

The states with the lowest occupancy rates are Nagaland (30.8%) and Lakshadweep (6.5%).

While scraping data was initially considered, Tableau offers a powerful and user-friendly alternative for analyzing Indian prison statistics. Although a map might be ideal for visualizing regional distribution, bar charts excel at ranking states and ensuring all area names are clearly displayed.
